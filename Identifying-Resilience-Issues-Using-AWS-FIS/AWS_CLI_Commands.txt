1) Download the following 2 files to your working directory, it is easiest to work in the AWS CloudShell to get this done:
  fis-role-trust-policy.json
  fis-role-permissions-policy.json
  
  From the AWS CloudShell, run the following commands to download these files to your Chouldshell environment: 
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACloudGuru-Resources/content-chaos-engineering-aws-fault-injection-simulator/main/Identifying-Resilience-Issues-Using-AWS-FIS/fis-role-permissions-policy.json
  
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACloudGuru-Resources/content-chaos-engineering-aws-fault-injection-simulator/main/Identifying-Resilience-Issues-Using-AWS-FIS/fis-role-trust-policy.json
  
  
2) After downloading the 2 files. In the CloudShell, run the following commmand to create an experiment role and add a trust policy:

aws iam create-role --role-name my-fis-role --assume-role-policy-document file://fis-role-trust-policy.json

3) Finally add a permissions policy to the role you just created:

aws iam put-role-policy --role-name my-fis-role --policy-name my-fis-policy --policy-document file://fis-role-permissions-policy.json

These steps will give AWS FIS the permissions required to perfom the experiments that we are going to run during the lab, e.g. it will allow it to reboot, stop and terminate EC2 instances.
